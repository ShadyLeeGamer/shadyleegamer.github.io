				<div class="description">
					<p>Recently published a high-speed anime platformer on Steam, with the help of my sister (artist) for designing and animating the player and levels. The game features complex gravity-bending physics with open levels and mechanics that encourages fast-paced gameplay.</p>
					<p>The biggest technical challenge for me was developing the raycast and engine physics character controller which functions on a variety of mechanics during gameplay.</p>

							<h2>Raycast & Engine Physics Character Controller</h2>

							<div class="accordion">
								<div class="accordion-item">
									<div class="accordion-header">Collision</div>
									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>Collision is handled by raycasting a circle collider onto surfaces.</p>

										<p>This method was inspired by the use of spheres as hitboxes in Super Mario Galaxy, due to its round shape, we can prevent the side effects of gravity bending physics.</p>
										<p>I found this to be more suitable than sensor rays as used in the classic Sonic games due to the bugs that occur when standing on slanted ledges and pointy terrain. This is demonstrated in the clip below of the WIP classic Sonic physics prototype of I was making.</p>
									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="accordion-item">
									<div class="accordion-header">Edge Running</div>
									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>While wall running, when the player reaches the edge of a wall, they will perform an ‘edge run’. where they drift off at a constant velocity. This stunt can also be used to seamlessly cross over small gaps.</p>
										<p>Edge run is executed when there is no surface underneath the player or a steep slope angle threshold has been reached.</p>
										<p>This is made possible by the CONTROL LOCK DISTANCE mechanic.</p>
									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="accordion-item">
									<div class="accordion-header">Wall jumping & Ricocheting</div>
									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>Wall jump is achieved by reflecting the player’s velocity off the surface as well as initiating a CONTROL LOCK.</p>
										<p>The reflected velocity is then normalised with some of the surface normal to bounce further away from the wall. This adjustment was made to more easily wall jump over spikes while wall running more effectively.</p>
										
										<p>One secret mechanic I really wanted to include was the ability to ricochet in tunnels. Like external forces, doing so allows you to gain instant momentum by exceeding the normal speed capacity.</p>
										<p>However, this did not work well with the adjustment added as it causes the player to eventually ricochet in place.</p>
										<p>To overcome this, I excluded the normal vector if the player was ricocheting, which is defined by if they were constantly wall jumping without spamming the input and without unlocking the control lock distance. This was the result:</p>
									
									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="accordion-item">
									<div class="accordion-header">Control Lock Distance</div>
									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>The control lock distance is used to prevents directional input from influencing the player’s speed until they reach a certain amount of distance from lock point.</p>

										<p>This system was made flexible for use and is what ties all the other mechanics together such as edge running, wall jumping and hitting a launch pad.</p>
										<p>In older solutions, the control lock timer concept was used, however it wasn’t suitable as the amount of distance covered during control lock was inconsistent due to speed always changing, which conflicted level design.</p>
									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="accordion-item">
									<div class="accordion-header">Assist System (inspired by Celeste)</div>
									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>The game aids player inputs to better achieve desired actions through assists like snapping to missed nearby environments, dash distance extension, input buffering, etc.</p>
									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="accordion-item">
									<div class="accordion-header">Momentum-based movement</div>
									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>The player’s momentum is influenced by activity like player mechanics (running along slopes, edge running, wall jumping) and external forces (launch pads, and moving or rotating platforms).</p>
									</div>
								</div>
							</div>

							<h2>Other</h2>

							<div class="accordion">
								<div class="accordion-item">
									<div class="accordion-header">Pushing Splines to Limits!</div>
									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>With the world being built entirely out of splines, I developed an extension for Unity's Sprite Shape API that breaks splines down to segments and points for full control and flexibility.</p>
										<p>It is used for entity movement movement on splines like player grinding on rails, hazards moving on walls.</p>
										<p>It is also used to aid level design by displaying paths and point within a spline.</p>

										<p>Here we can see the script being used to break down the grind rail spline into evenly spaced points to allow the player to move along the rail.</p>

										<p>It is used similarly here for hazards moving along a path inside a wall. The spline path and points are visualised with an additional custom level editor tool.</p>

									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="accordion-item">
									<div class="accordion-header">Motion Platforms</div>
									<div class="accordion-content">
										<p>The moving and rotating platforms give more opportunity for the player to manoeuvre around the levels with exceeding speeds.</p>
